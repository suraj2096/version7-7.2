1. what is pattern matching?
pattern Matching is a process that takes expression and testing whether it matches certain criteria such as begin a specified type
or matching a specified constant value.
pattern matching is a check and so can be used when branching code.
 is ,switch statement,switch expression all support pattern matching.

why pattern matching useful?
pattern matching provide more concise way of testing expressions. 
for checking the expression by lengthy if-else statment ,pattern matching can simplify these operations.

is operator: the is operator is used to check whether an object is compatible with the specific type or not.


what is tuple? why do we need tuple in c#?
it is used to return more than one value from a method so we use tuple . 


major difference beteween out and ref is that 

ref is required the variable must be intialized before it send to the calling method but it is not in the case of out.
ref is used when we want to update the value from  a method. out is used when we want to return a value from a method
we cannot use value as input in out parameter.


extanded expression bodied members:
a method that includes just one statement can be written with the lambda expression.
a property with only a get accessor can be written with the same lambda expression.

expreession bodied method in c# 6 will be implemented to the method or properties

expression bodied methods enhanecement come in c# 7 where constuctor cna be written in
shorter syntax 


Note: async method kae andar always use await if you call another async method .

Note void returntype of async method then the async method cannot be awaited.
